# GOB Development Projects

This directory contains active development work that's beyond the experimental/ideas phase but not yet integrated into the main production codebase.

## Current Projects

### `ui-migration/`
**Status**: Planning → Implementation  
**Goal**: Migrate GOB's webui from feature-rich interface to minimalist terminal-style UI  
**Timeline**: 15 weeks (estimated)  
**Lead**: [Your name]

#### Structure:
- `docs/` - Migration plan, progress tracking, requirements
- `prototypes/` - UI mockups, experimental implementations  
- `tests/` - Regression tests for UI migration
- `assets/` - Design assets, screenshots, mockups

## Guidelines

- Each project should have its own README with current status
- Use branches for active development: `feature/project-name`
- Move completed projects to appropriate locations in main codebase
- Archive completed projects that don't merge to main

## Project Lifecycle

1. **Ideas** → Experimental concepts in `/ideas/`
2. **Development** → Active projects move here with structure
3. **Integration** → Features merge into `/gob/` production code  
4. **Archive** → Completed projects archived with documentation
