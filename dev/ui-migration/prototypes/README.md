# Agent Zero UI Candidate Testing

## Quick Start

**1. Start the test server:**
```bash
cd /home/ds/GOB/ideas/ui
python test_server.py
```

**2. Browser opens automatically to:**
`http://localhost:8080/minimal.html`

**3. Try these commands in the chat:**
- `/help` - Show available commands
- `/tier mesh` - Switch to mesh tier
- `/clear` - Clear chat
- `/status` - Show status

## Files

- `minimal.html` - The UI candidate (terminal-style chat interface)
- `test_server.py` - Local HTTP server for testing
- `UI_EVALUATION.md` - Complete evaluation framework and scoring system
- `README.md` - This file

## Quick Evaluation

### âœ… What Works Well
- Authentic terminal/hacker aesthetic with dark theme
- Clean, responsive design that works on different screen sizes
- Interactive command system with `/` commands
- Real-time status updates (tier, message count, time)
- Smooth animations and visual feedback

### ðŸ”§ What Needs Work
- Currently uses mock responses (needs Agent Zero API integration)
- No message persistence (lost on page reload)
- Limited command set (needs expansion)
- No file upload or advanced features yet

### ðŸŽ¯ Key Questions to Answer
1. **Visual Appeal**: Does this look professional for Agent Zero?
2. **User Experience**: Is it intuitive and easy to use?
3. **Brand Fit**: Does it match the Agent Zero concept/brand?
4. **Extensibility**: Can we easily add features later?

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Open in browser and test basic typing
- [ ] Try all slash commands (`/help`, `/tier`, `/clear`, `/status`)
- [ ] Switch between tiers (node, link, mesh, grid)
- [ ] Test on mobile/tablet screen sizes
- [ ] Evaluate the overall look and feel

## Next Steps

If this UI candidate passes evaluation:
1. Integrate with Agent Zero backend API
2. Add WebSocket for real-time streaming
3. Implement message persistence
4. Add file upload capabilities
5. Create settings/configuration panel
